# Case Study: E-commerce API Development

This case study evaluates your understanding of backend development concepts, ability 
to design and implement a RESTful API, and problem-solving/coding skills.
Scenario:
Develop a secure and scalable RESTful API for an e-commerce platform. Users can create 
accounts, manage products, place orders, and track shipments.
Requirements:

## User Authentication:
• Implement a secure JWT (JSON Web Token) based authentication system for 
login and authorization.
Product Management:
• Develop endpoints for adding, editing, and deleting products.
• Include fields for product name, description, price, quantity, and image URL.
• Implement search and filtering functionality for products.
Order Management:
• Create endpoints for placing orders, viewing order history, and updating order 
status.
• Include fields for customer information, order items, and shipping address.
Database Design:
• Design a relational database schema to store user data, products, orders, and 
shipment information.
• Ensure data integrity and consistency

## Technical Considerations:
• Choose a suitable backend language like Node.js, Python (with Django or Flask),
Laravel or any language of your choice.
• Use a popular framework for your chosen language (e.g., Express.js for Node.js, 
Django for Python, Laravel for PHP etc.).
• Employ a relational database like MySQL, PostgreSQL, or SQLite.
• Design the API adhering to RESTful principles (proper HTTP methods and status 
codes).
• Focus on security measures like input validation, data sanitization, and protection 
against vulnerabilities (e.g., SQL injection, cross-site scripting).
Evaluation Criteria:
• Functionality: Does the API meet all requirements?
• Code Quality: Is the code well-structured, readable, and maintainable?
• Security: Are appropriate security measures in place?
• Efficiency: Does the API perform efficiently under load?
• API Design: Does the API adhere to RESTful principles?
• Documentation: Is the API well-documented with clear instructions
